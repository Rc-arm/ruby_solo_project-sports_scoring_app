# Sports Scoring App

### An app for showing teams and fixtures in a league

This is version 1.0.

I created the app using Ruby and Sinatra as my first project during week 5 (August 2019) of the CodeClan Professional Software Development course.

Upon completion of the course I have recreated the app using different languages and frameworks in order to further understand the implementation of functionality and design choices.

Other versions:
- Version 2.0 - Since version 1.0 was created using a Mac I recreated the app using Windows: [Sports Scoring App - Ruby & Sinatra (created on Windows)](https://github.com/rcarmitage/codeclan_solo_project-sports_scoring_app_v2.0_ruby_sinatra)
- Version 3.0: [Sports Scoring App - JavaScript & Vue](https://github.com/rcarmitage/codeclan_solo_project-sports_scoring_app_v3.0_javascript_vue)
- Version 4.0 (pending): Sports Scoring App - JavaScript & React

## Brief

### MVP:
A user should be able toâ€¦

- Create, edit and delete teams to the league
- Create, edit and delete fixtures
- There should be a way to display all the fixtures for a team and all the teams involved in a fixture
- The app should display if a fixture was won or lost

### Extensions:
- Create a league table to see who is on top of the league
- Self-selected extension: Add "Play a Game" functionality, i.e. the user would select two teams and the app would select a winner from these

## App Details

Status of the app and plans for further development as of 29th January 2020:
- _This version of the app is not currently functional. I plan to bring it back to basic functionality so it can be compared with the further developed verson 2.0._

## My learning

- During the 6 days given to complete the project I initially allocated too much time to the extensions functionality at the expense of MVP functionality. I included the League Table in the design from the beginning, neglecting the MVP CRUD functionality for Teams and Fixtures until close to the presentation date.
- I have learned that for future projects I must focus on the baseline functionality until it is able to run bug-free. After this I will begin to add features incrementally.
- I found it frustrating to problem solve when the gaps in my knowledge left me unsure where I should focus to find a solution. I have learned that there are many resources (documentation, blogs, video tutorials) to turn to. I have found that sitting down to talk through the problem with another person - either an instructor or another member of my cohort - usually opens up avenues of further enquiry and sometimes produces immediate solutions. In my future projects I will make time to talk through the tasks as I am completing them.
