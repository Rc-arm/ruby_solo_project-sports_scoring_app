# Sports Scoring App

### An app created using Ruby and Sinatra to show teams and fixtures in a league.

This is version 1.0 of the app, which I created for the first project of the CodeClan Professional Software Development course.

Since the course has ended I have created the same app using different languages and frameworks to further my understanding of these technologies and the process of implementing design choices and functionality.

### v2.0
- Since v1.0 was created on a MacBook Pro, I recreated it from scratch on Windows
- (GitHub link)

### v3.0
- This was written in JavaScript and created using Vue
- (GitHub link)

### v4.0
- This will be written in JavaScript and created using React
- (GitHub link pending)

## Brief

### MVP:
A user should be able toâ€¦

- Create, edit and delete teams to the league
- Create, edit and delete games
- There should be a way to display all the games for a team and all the teams involved in a game
- The app should display if a game was won or lost

### Extensions:
- Create a league table to see who is on top of the league
-
