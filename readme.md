# Sports Scoring App

### An app created to show teams and fixtures in a league.

This is version 1.0 of the app, which I created for the first project of the CodeClan Professional Software Development course.

Since the course has ended I have recreated the app using different languages and frameworks to further my understanding of implementing design choices and functionality.

### Version 2.0
- Since v1.0 was created on a Mac I recreated it on Windows
- [Sports Scoring App - Ruby & Sinatra (created on Windows)](https://github.com/rcarmitage/codeclan_solo_project-sports_scoring_app_v2.0_ruby_sinatra)

### Version 3.0
- [Sports Scoring App - JavaScript & Vue](https://github.com/rcarmitage/codeclan_solo_project-sports_scoring_app_v3.0_javascript_vue)

### Version 4.0 (pending)
- Sports Scoring App - JavaScript & React

## Brief

### MVP:
A user should be able toâ€¦

- Create, edit and delete teams to the league
- Create, edit and delete games
- There should be a way to display all the games for a team and all the teams involved in a game
- The app should display if a game was won or lost

### Extensions:
- Create a league table to see who is on top of the league
- Self-selected extension: Add "Play a Game" functionality, i.e. the user would select two teams and the app would select a winner from these

## My learning

- During the 6 days given to complete the project, I initially allocated too much time to the extensions functionality. I included the league table in the design from the beginning, neglecting the MVP CRUD functionality for teams and fixtures until close to the presentation date.
- For future projects I have learned that I must focus on the baseline functionality until it is able to run bug-free. After this I will begin to add features incrementally.
